                    WHOA this is a really loud site. Can you read everything alright? It's pretty crazy, right? I know. Yeah- I really like shit like this. 
                    You might be wondering why I used the "hell" subdomain. <br><br>

                    Hey.. hey, man. It's.. it's because I'm in hell right now. Actually, that's not entirely accurate. But let's not get into it... Actually, yeah let's get into it. <br><br>

                    First off, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gw_sk/">@gw_sk</a> is filming a transmedia documentary called Golden Boy about post-modernism, feminism and masculinity centered around me 
                    from Feb to April 2017. <i>There will probably be a link here sometime for more details on that</i>. <br><br>
                    
                    Second off, I'm busting my ass on Univjobs- a student recruitment startup that we started around Sheridan. It's been going pretty well so far, but really.. I'm just trying 
                    not to burn out (and pay my rent). <br><br>

                    Lastly, I'm finding (s'little) time to do what I actually love to do- that's making music through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cyanidecanaries/">@cyanidecanaries</a>, 
                    Debutante and collaborating with other designers, animators, developers and musicians.<br><br>

                    I'm going to use this space to share a few thoughts during shooting of the Golden Boy documentary in addition to further alienating my friends and family.

                    If you need me for something or need to send me more death threats (remember that, Sheridan? I was the first mf named on that disturbing 
                    death threat incident a few months ago. Get on my level), do it here at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stemmlerjs/">@stemmlerjs</a>.<br><br>

                    Peace and love, respect. Pappa bless.<br><br>
